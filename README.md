# noise-of-life
A database for everyday's life sounds.

# Sources and credits

A smaller version of this database was used during my PhD at Telecom SudParis and ESIGETEL between 2010 and 2013. Most of the content was recorded or gathered from the web by me or by former team members. I can unfortunately not provide links to material downloaded within that period. Current version contains material downloaded exclusively from [freesound.org](https://freesound.org/) and licensed under a Creative Commons license. Most of the files from [freesound.org](https://freesound.org/) were trimmed to extract the interesting parts. Links to the respective files will be added as soon as possible.
